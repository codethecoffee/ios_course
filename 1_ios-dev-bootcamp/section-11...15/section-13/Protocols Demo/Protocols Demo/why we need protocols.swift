/**
 A swift code file showing why we need protocols. Relying on class inheritance can get very messy.
 
 The premise: We own a flying museum, where we demo flying birds. We, quite reasonably, start off by
 declaring a Bird class. All Birds can lay eggs (if female) and fly. We start creating subclasses for more
 specific kinds of birds, and it works great so far for the Eagle.
 
 However, now we're going to show penguins as well (don't question it), and now penguins can fly because
 they're inheriting from the class Bird!
 
 Our flying demos are a huge success so we decide to show demos of flying objects as well. The flyingDemo
 method only takes Bird objects, thus we're forced to define our Plane class as a subclass of Bird. Now,
 because of this, planes can lay eggs! What a mess.
